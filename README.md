# rocket
I've decided to share my colorscheme for vim. It's been my daily driver for the past 10 years, and changed a lot along the ways. 

Notes
-----
1. Supports many different languages.
3. Intended for True Color for the time being.

Warning
-------
I use a lot of non-default highlighting groups along with custom syntax files. YMMV
